# Luis' Vim Configuration

Just a place to store my vim configuration, plugins, documentation, etc.

## Installation:
1. Clone to a folder named ".vim" in your home folder
2. Edit the default vimrc ("_vimrc" in windows, ".vimrc" in linux) to contain only the following line:
  `source ~/.vim/vimrc`
3. Enjoy!

## Commands:
### Editing Shortcuts:
- Surround visual selection with `()`, `{}`, `[]`, or `<space>` by using `,(`, `,{`, `,[`, and `,<space>`
- Move current line, or visual line selection, up or down by using `<Ctrl>k` and `<Ctrl>j`
